# Nonogram Puzzle Generator

> Now open source! Used to generate my puzzle "Refinement Protocol" for the [2025 Microsoft Puzzle Safari](https://25.puzzlesafari.net/Home/AfterEventWithScores)

This is a "two-phase" nonogram puzzle generator. These are the instructions provided to players:


> **LUMON INDUSTRIES â€” MACRODATA REFINEMENT DIVISION**
> 
> Refiners, your next data sequence requires completion in two phases:
>
> **Phase 01:** Apply foundation protocol by shading cells according to the **BLACK** sequences.
>
> **Phase 02:** Fill remaining cells, then perform refinement by erasing cells according to the **RED** sequences.
>
> Refer to the employee handbook for more information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram
>
> _Note: Refinement tools (pencil and eraser) suggested. This work is mysterious and important._
